        <p align="justify"><br> In this on the front page there are different options that are sign up, company panel, 
            student panel, home, services, salary guide, about and contact.
            In the company panel we have to enter company name and password. After entering 
            correct details it will display the card of company and on that card there is option i.e. “see 
            detail’s” so after clicking on that it will display the company information. And in our project 
            there are 25 companies are there and data of each company is stored in the database. 
            In sign up page there is a form in which we have to enter our details like name, email, 
            date of birth etc. After submitting it our data will store the table student. Job table in the 
            database. Also on this sign up page there is option for sign in.
            <br><br>In the student panel there are two options that are what and where in which we have to 
            enter company name and location. After click on submit it will display company card and 
            option for apply is present below. After click on apply there is a form in which we have to enter 
            our details like name, email, date of birth etc. After submitting it our data will store in the table

   <br><img src="Facial_paralysis.jpeg">
    <p align="justify">Facial paralysis detection is beneficial because it detects asymmetry in symptoms in face. First of all the system takes photos of face, which is then processed and detect facial paralysis using our trained model. And then it will show result, if any disease is their then it will notify us. The facial paralysis is detected using the Inception V3 model (Convolutional Neural Network). In terms of testing and validation accuracy,the intermediate results are presented. It is observed that the best training accuracy for Inception, 99.33 percent is obtained at the 31st epoch and the best test accuracy, 89.87 percent is obtained at the 25th epoch and for cnn  best training accuracy, 98.57 percent is obtained at the 40th epoch and the best test accuracy, 89.87 percent is obtained at the 22nh epoch. Lastly, we conclude our result.
